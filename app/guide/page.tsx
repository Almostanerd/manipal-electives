      <h1 className="hero-title">PE, OE & CGPA — in simple human terms.</h1>
      <p className="hero-subtitle">
        I received some <b>20+ DMs</b> from y&apos;all about electives. Got wary of
        replying individually, so this is a cleaned-up version of all the chaotic
        DMs, screenshots and senior gyaan I collected while being confused myself.
      </p>

      <section className="section">
        <h2>Q. What are PE and OE (practically)?</h2>
        <p>
          OE (Open Electives) are the chill ones. OEs don&apos;t contribute to GPA
          (just like UHV/HRC from 1st year), so just pick something you&apos;ll enjoy
          and can easily pass. Popular picks are Film Studies, Report Writing,
          French, etc.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginTop: "0.6rem", opacity: 0.85 }}>
          PE (Program Electives), on the other hand, <b>do</b> contribute to your
          CGPA. These matter more academically and for your resume, especially if
          you&apos;re aiming for higher studies or tech roles.
        </p>

      <section className="section">
        <h2>Q. Why does everyone keep recommending Coursera?</h2>
        <p>
          Almost every senior I talked to suggested Coursera-based electives for
          PEs. The biggest reason is simple: <b>no physical classes required</b>.
        </p>
        <ul className="section-list">
          <li>You usually don&apos;t need to attend offline lectures.</li>
          <li>Midsems are often just MCQs for ~15 marks.</li>
          <li>With minimal effort, people easily get 45+ internals.</li>
          <li>The time saved can be used for placements or other core subjects.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style={{ marginTop: "0.6rem", opacity: 0.85 }}>
          From what seniors say, Coursera PEs are generally very scoring and
          stress-free compared to offline electives.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="section">
        <h2>Q. Which PE is the most suggested Coursera course?</h2>
        <p>
          From what I&apos;ve heard specifically from <b>CCE seniors</b>, the
          <b> Big Data Coursera PE</b> is by far the most commonly suggested option.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginTop: "0.6rem", opacity: 0.85 }}>
          It&apos;s considered easy, scoring, and also useful for tech resumes and
          higher studies profiles — which is why so many people end up taking it.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="section">
        <h2>Q. Which PEs are usually Coursera-based?</h2>
        <p>
          There&apos;s no official list floating around clearly, but most seniors say
          that <b>course codes starting with CRA</b> are generally Coursera-backed.
          Still, this isn&apos;t 100% confirmed — always double-check the course code
          details before locking.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginTop: "0.6rem", opacity: 0.85 }}>
          Popular Coursera-backed PEs people talk about:
          <br />
          Digital Marketing, Big Data Modelling & related analytics courses.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="section">
        <h2>Q. What about CGPA cutoffs?</h2>
        <p>
          There is <b>no fixed universal cutoff</b>. Different people told different
          things, but the rough consensus is:
        </p>
        <ul className="section-list">
          <li>7 – 7.5 CGPA is good enough for most cases.</li>
          <li>8.5+ is considered very safe.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style={{ marginTop: "0.6rem", opacity: 0.85 }}>
          This obviously depends on the company, role and competition in that year,
          but this is the general range most seniors agree on (for placements). It is quite similar for course cut offs too.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="section">
        <h2>Q. Taking a minor vs not taking a minor — what’s the real difference?</h2>
        <p>
          Taking a <b>minor</b> means you have to do a few extra related PEs and an
          additional <b>project / report / paper</b>. That extra work lets you
          officially show the minor on your transcript.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginTop: "0.6rem", opacity: 0.85 }}>
          The upside: you can potentially get a <b>research paper</b> out of it,
          which really helps for an <b>academic or higher-studies focused resume</b>.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginTop: "0.6rem", opacity: 0.85 }}>
          The constraint: with a minor, you usually <b>can’t freely mix unrelated
          PEs</b>. Your electives have to stay within that minor&apos;s domain.
        </p>
      </section>


<section className="section">
  <h2>Q. What about the Minor Specialization Project (8 credits)? Does it count for CGPA?</h2>
  <p>
    Yes — the <b>minor specialization project is graded and counted towards your
    CGPA</b>. It is <b>not</b> Satisfactory / Non-Satisfactory like UHV/CPI.
  </p>
  <p style={{ marginTop: "0.6rem", opacity: 0.85 }}>
    There is still a bit of uncertainty about whether the grade is multiplied by
    the full <b>8 credits</b> or calculated differently for GPA. Different people
    seem to have different information on this, so it’s best to double-check with
    your dept once officially notified.
  </p>

      <section className="section">
        <h2>Q. How do I choose between Marketing vs Tech PEs?</h2>
        <p>
          This is honestly very personal. Some seniors prefer Digital Marketing
          because it&apos;s lighter and more interest-based. Others suggest Big Data
          because:
        </p>
        <ul className="section-list">
          <li>It&apos;s considered relatively easy.</li>
          <li>It looks good for tech resumes.</li>
          <li>It helps if you&apos;re aiming for higher studies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style={{ marginTop: "0.6rem", opacity: 0.85 }}>
          If you&apos;re more comfortable with humanities, Marketing might feel more
          natural. If you prefer tech, Big Data is a safe bet.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="section">
        <h2>Q. What did one senior personally choose?</h2>
        <p>
          One senior I spoke to took <b>Digital Marketing</b> simply because they
          were curious to see what a marketing course feels like. They also
          mentioned that Big Data is similarly easy from what they&apos;ve heard.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginTop: "0.6rem", opacity: 0.85 }}>
          Their final advice was: unless you&apos;re genuinely passionate about an
          offline PE, take a Coursera one and save your energy.

          <li>Use the filters to separate OE, PE with minor, and PE without minor.</li>
          <li>Shortlist based on your comfort: chill vs grind, tech vs humanities.</li>
          <li>Then verify with at least 2–3 seniors before locking.</li>
          <li>Don&apos;t blindly follow just one person&apos;s opinion.</li>
